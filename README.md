# mit6.006
That's the fundamental course I am taking from MIT OpenCourseWare ([ocw.mit.edu](https://ocw.mitd.edu)) as part of my 
journey to transition from a software/product developer into a focused software engineer. Yahh, the engineering stuff.
This course may however lead me to other topics and so forth, so not only will MIT stuff be here. 

What I document here are based on the way I study.
